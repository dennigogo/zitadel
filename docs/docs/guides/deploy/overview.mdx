title: Overview
---

Choose your platform and run ZITADEL with the most minimal configuration possible.
For an easy self-hosted production setup, we recommend running ZITADEL on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/), using our official [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) chart.
By default, it runs a highly available ZITADEL instance along with a secure and highly available [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/) instance.

- [Linux](./linux)
- [MacOS](./macos)
- [Docker Compose](./compose)
- [Knative](./knative)
- [Kubernetes](./kubernetes)

## Prerequisits

- ZITADEL does not need many resources, 1 CPU and 512MB memory are more than enough. (With more CPU, the password hashing might be faster)
- A cockroachDB or Postgresql (currently in beta) as only needed storage
- If you want to front ZITADEL with a reverse proxy, web application firewall or content delivery network, make sure to support [HTTP/2](../manage/self-hosted/http2)


## Releases

The easiest way to use ZITADEL is to run one of our container releases

- ZITADEL does provide latest and stable [container images](https://github.com/dennigogo/zitadel/pkgs/container/zitadel)
- **stable** is the current **production** release of ZITADEL.
- **latest** is the **last created** release from our pipelines that gets updated on a high frequency.
