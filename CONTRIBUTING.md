### Backend / Login

By executing the commands from this section, you run everything you need to develop the ZITADEL backend locally.
Using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you run a [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker-mac.html) on your local machine.
With [goreleaser](https://opencollective.com/goreleaser), you build a debuggable ZITADEL binary and run it using [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve).
Then, you test your changes via the console your binary is serving at http://<span because="breaks the link"></span>localhost:8080 and by verifying the database.
Once you are happy with your changes, you run end-to-end tests and tear everything down.

The commands in this section are tested against the following software versions:

- [Docker version 20.10.17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Goreleaser version v1.8.3](https://goreleaser.com/install/)
- [Go version 1.19](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Delve 1.9.1](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/v1.9.1/Documentation/installation)

<!-- TODO: Describe linting (@adlerhurst) -->

Make some changes to the source code, then run the database locally.

```bash
# You just need the db service to develop the backend against.
docker compose --file ./e2e/docker-compose.yaml up --detach db
```

Build the binary. This takes some minutes, but you can speed up rebuilds.

```bash
# You just need goreleasers build part (--snapshot) and you just need to target your current platform (--single-target)
goreleaser build --id dev --snapshot --single-target --rm-dist --output .artifacts/zitadel/zitadel
```

> Note: With this command, several steps are executed.
> For speeding up rebuilds, you can reexecute only specific steps you think are necessary based on your changes.  
> Generating gRPC stubs: `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f build/zitadel/Dockerfile . --target go-copy -o .`  
> Running unit tests: `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f build/zitadel/Dockerfile . --target go-codecov`  
> Generating the console: `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f build/console/Dockerfile . --target angular-export -o internal/api/ui/console/static/`  
> Build the binary: `goreleaser build --id dev --snapshot --single-target --rm-dist --output .artifacts/zitadel/zitadel --skip-before`

You can now run and debug the binary in .artifacts/zitadel/zitadel using your favourite IDE, for example GoLand.
You can test if ZITADEL does what you expect by using the UI at http://localhost:8080/ui/console.
Also, you can verify the data by running `cockroach sql --database zitadel --insecure` and running SQL queries.

As soon as you are ready to battle test your changes, run the end-to-end tests.

```bash
# Build the production binary (unit tests are executed, too)
goreleaser build --id prod --snapshot --single-target --rm-dist --output .artifacts/zitadel/zitadel

# Pack the binary into a docker image
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --file build/Dockerfile .artifacts/zitadel -t zitadel:local

# Run the tests
ZITADEL_IMAGE=zitadel:local docker compose --file ./e2e/docker-compose.yaml run e2e
```

When you are happy with your changes, you can cleanup your environment.

```bash
# Stop and remove the docker containers for zitadel and the database
docker compose --file ./e2e/docker-compose.yaml down
```

### Console

By executing the commands from this section, you run everything you need to develop the console locally.
Using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you run [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.1/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker-mac.html) and the [latest release of ZITADEL](https://github.com/dennigogo/zitadel/releases/latest) on your local machine.
You use the ZITADEL container as backend for your console.
The console is run in your [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) environment using [a local development server for Angular](https://angular.io/cli/serve#ng-serve), so you have fast feedback about your changes.

We use angular-eslint/Prettier for linting/formatting, so please run `npm run lint:fix` before committing. (VSCode users, check out [this ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [this Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to fix lint and formatting issues in development)

Once you are happy with your changes, you run end-to-end tests and tear everything down.

The commands in this section are tested against the following software versions:

- [Docker version 20.10.17](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Node version v16.17.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm version 8.18.0](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm)
- [Cypress runtime dependencies](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Dependencies)
- [curl version 7.58.0](https://curl.se/download.html)

  <summary>Note for WSL2 on Windows 10</summary>
  Following the suggestions <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62641553/setup-cypress-on-wsl-ubuntu-for-windows-10">here </a> subsequently <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4106">here </a> may  need to XLaunch and configure your DISPLAY variable. Use at your own risk.

1. Install `VcXsrv Windows X Server`
2. Set the target of your shortcut to `"C:\Program Files\VcXsrv\xlaunch.exe" -ac`
3. In WSL2 run `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0` to set your DISPLAY variable
4. When starting XLaunch, make sure to disable access control

Run the database and the latest backend locally.

```bash
# Change to the console directory
cd ./console

# You just need the db and the zitadel services to develop the console against.
docker compose --file ../e2e/docker-compose.yaml up --detach db zitadel
```

When the backend is ready, you have the latest zitadel exposed at http://localhost:8080.
You can now run a local development server with live code reloading at http://localhost:4200.
To allow console access via http://localhost:4200, you have to configure the ZITADEL backend.

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ui/console/projects.
2. When prompted, login with _zitadel-admin@<span because="breaks the mailto"></span>zitadel.localhost_ and _Password1!_
3. Select the _ZITADEL_ project.
4. Select the _Console_ application.
5. Select _Redirect Settings_
6. Add _http://<span because="breaks the link"></span>localhost:4200/auth/callback_ to the _Redirect URIs_
7. Add _http://<span because="breaks the link"></span>localhost:4200/signedout_ to the _Post Logout URIs_
8. Select the _Save_ button

You can run the local console development server now.

```bash
# Console loads its target environment from the file console/src/assets/environment.json.
# Load it from the backend.
curl http://localhost:8080/ui/console/assets/environment.json > ./src/assets/environment.json

# Generate source files from Protos
npm run generate

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
Make some changes to the source code and see how the browser is automatically updated.
After making changes to the code, you should run the end-to-end-tests.
Open another shell.

```bash
# Change to the e2e directory
cd .. && cd e2e/

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests in a headless browser
npm run e2e:dev
```

You can also open the test suite interactively for fast success feedback on specific tests.

```bash
# Run all tests in a headless browser
npm run open:dev
```

When you are happy with your changes, you can cleanup your environment

```bash
# Stop and remove the docker containers for zitadel and the database
docker compose down
```
